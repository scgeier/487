## Course Description

This course teaches web development, web design and interactive storytelling. Students use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and other programming languages to design, storyboard and script interactive projects. They collect and incorporate photos, text, video, graphics and database information into interactive multimedia presentations of the caliber one would expect in a major online publication.

This course expands on the skills learned in MEJO 187 and increases students' ability to develop and present interactive media. They begin by learning more advanced CSS and HTML, with an eye toward the latest CSS methods for responsive design. They then learn essential skills in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., jQuery). Finally, they couple their JavaScript skills with a knowledge of data visualization libraries and APIs to produce dynamic, data-driven web apps.
